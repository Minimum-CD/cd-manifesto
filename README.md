# Minimum Viable Continuous Delivery

This is a community project to define the minimum set of practices that give the expected improvements to outcomes, quality of life, and organizational structure that come with continuous delivery.

The website for this project, contained in this repo, is currently hosted at [MinimumCD.org](https://minimumcd.org/minimumcd/)

## Running Locally

### Install Hugo

[Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/), the open-source static site generator used in this project.

You can most easily install the latest version, but these versions of Hugo matter:

- The build version in [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- The deploy version in [netlify.toml](netlify.toml)

You can install a particular version locally using [Prebuilt binaries](https://gohugo.io/installation/macos/#prebuilt-binaries). You need an "extended" version (to build SCSS/SASS with transpiler set to 'libsass').

### Commands

This site uses NPM scripts to automate style checks.

`npm ci` will install all pre-commit hooks to verify style errors and test before allowing commits.

`npm test` will validate formatting. This will also run automatically as a pre-commit hook.

`npm start` will run the site locally.

`npm run build` will create the static site if you need to see the resulting structure.
