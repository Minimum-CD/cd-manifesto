# Contributing

You don't need to be a developer to make a positive impact on the industry by contributing to the CD Manifesto documentation and examples, just a [GitHub account](https://github.com/).

## Changes to the practices

Suggestions to modify the core practices should be created using [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Minimum-CD/cd-manifesto/issues/new/choose). The core team will meet at a regular cadence and review the suggestions and debate if they are required for the minimum standard for CD. We will either add them at that point, decline to add them, or request clarification from the issue's author.

## Changes to supporting information

To request a change to supporting information should be created by raising a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Minimum-CD/cd-manifesto/issues/new/choose). The core team will review ASAP, request clarification as needed, and make the change as required.

Suggested changes may be re-phrased for clarity, but we will verify intent with the requestor in the PR.

## Adding your signature

If you agree that this is MinimumCD, please create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) to add your signature to the [signature file](data/names/signatures.yml). We are determined to be good custodians of the core principles and promise that any changes to the practices will receive much scrutiny.

## Removing your signature

If we fail to uphold the ideals we've stated and you wish to remove your signature, please raise a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) and we will remove you without delay.

## Community Discussions

For transparency, we will have discussions and answer questions using [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Minimum-CD/cd-manifesto/discussions). Please reach out!

## Working Agreement

Anyone on the core team can review and accept a signature request. Signatories are encouraged to include a preferred form of contact to answer questions, but it is not required.

For a practice to be considered part of MinimumCD:

1. It is deemed "fundamental" and works in all contexts
2. The goal of the practice is to amplify feedback, reduce batch size, or reduce toil
3. Not doing it creates an unacceptable risk to the end-user in all contexts
4. It can be objectively assessed to be true or false
