With the advent of coding agents, large portions of source code can be generated by AI in a short period of time.
However, unless additional artifacts are introduced, agentic drift code quality issues and technical debt will accumulate quickly.
By the time this becomes visible, it's often unmanageable and irreversible.
The introduction of additional first-class artifacts ("documentation artifacts") can address this challenge.
These artifacts need to become part of the repository itself.
Continously maintaining and delivering these additional artifacts becomes the key control variable in sustained use of agentic coding.

## Agentic Extensions to MinimumCD

Agentic Continuous Delivery (ACD) is the application of Continuous Delivery in environments where software changes are proposed by agents.
ACD exists to reliably constrain agent autonomy without slowing delivery.

It *extends* MinimumCD by the following constraints:

- Explicit, human-owned intent exists for every change
- Intent and architecture are represented as first-class artifacts
- All first-class artifacts are versioned and delivered together with the change
- Intended behavior is represented independently of implementation
- Consistency between intent, tests, implementation, and architecture is enforced
- Agent-generated changes must comply with all documented constraints
- Agents implementing changes must not be able to promote those changes to production
- While the pipeline is red, agents may only generate changes restoring pipeline health

These constraints are **not mandatory practices.** They describe the *minimum conditions required to sustain delivery pace once agents are making changes* to the system.

## First-Class Artifacts

In ACD, every first-class artifact:

- Is required to exist
- Has a clearly defined authority
- Must always be consistent with other first-class artifacts
- Cannot be silently bypassed by agents or humans

It is part of the delivery contract, not a convenience.

- Agents may read any or all artifacts.
- Agents may *generate* some artifacts.
- Agents may **not** redefine the authority of any artifact.
- Humans own the accountability for the artifacts.

### Artifact Overview

| Artifact | Role (Why it exists) | Authority | What it Constrains | Purpose in ACD | Example |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ----------- | -------------------- | --------------- | --------- |
| **Intent Description** (Demand / Requirement) | Defines *why* the change exists | Human-owned intent | Scope, direction, outcome acceptability | Trust anchor for all other artifacts | "User activity data export required for compliance." |
| **User-Facing Behavior** (Feature User Guide) | Defines *what* users experience | Externally observable semantics | Tests, behavior, backward compatibility | Prevent unexplained behavioral drift | "Export available under Profile: Activity Export." |
| **Feature Description** (Implementation Manual) | Preserves implementation *trade-offs* | Engineering constraints | Technical decision boundaries, agent freedom | Prevent agentic trade-off drift | "Timestamped PDF retained for non-repudiability." |
| **Executable Truth** (Test Scenarios) | Makes intent *falsifiable* | Pipeline-enforced correctness | Code, refactoring, optimization | Enforce consistency | "Tests validating report completeness." |
| **Implementation** (Code) | Implements behavior | Runtime mechanics only | Fully constrained by other artifacts | Deliver the solution | Backend + frontend export logic |
| **System Constraints** (Architecture Overview) | Defines *global invariants* | System-level rules | All features, implementations, agent proposals | Maintain global integrity | "Always use MVC. No business logic in APIs." |

### Why These Artifacts Must Be Separate

They are intentionally **overlapping in content** but **non-overlapping in authority**.
The content overlap is necessary to control drift.

This prevents a critical agentic failure mode:
> Resolving inconsistency by rewriting the wrong thing.

## Why This Is Not Documentation Overhead

ACD treats **semantic artifacts** as first-class to **preserve consistent meaning** over time.

In ACD:

- Artifacts are **inputs to enforcement**
- Not outputs for humans to read

They exist so that:

- tools can reference them
- agents can be constrained by them
- humans can steer **exceptions and conflicts**

Removing even a single first-class artifact reduces the reliability of ACD reference frame.

## Closing remarks

None of these artifacts are required exclusively when working with coding agents: They should exist for any long-term development project.
However, creating and maintaining them as part of the delivery process becomes crucial to minimize the risk of agent-induced failure.
