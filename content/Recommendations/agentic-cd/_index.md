With the advent of coding agents, large portions of source code can be generated by AI in a short period of time.
However, unless additional artifacts are introduced, the agentic drift and code quality issues and technical debt accumulate quickly.
The introduction of additional first-class artifacts ("documentation artifacts") need to become part of the repository.
Continously maintaining and delivering these additional artifacts becomes the key control variable in sustained use of agentic coding.

## Agentic Extensions to MinimumCD

Agentic Continuous Delivery (ACD) is the application of Continuous Delivery in environments where software changes are proposed by agents.
ACD exists to reliably constrain agent autonomy without slowing delivery.

It extends MinimumCD by the following constraints:

- Explicit, human-owned intent exists for every change
- Intent and architecture are represented as first-class artifacts
- All first-class artifacts are versioned and delivered together with the change
- Intended behavior is represented independently of implementation
- Consistency between intent, tests, implementation, and architecture is enforced
- Agent-generated changes must comply with all documented constraints
- Agents implementing changes must not be able to promote those changes to production
- While the pipeline is red, agents may only generate changes restoring pipeline health

These constraints are **not mandatory practices.** They describe the *minimum conditions required to sustain delivery pace once agents are making changes* to the system.


## First-Class Artifacts

In ACD, a first-class artifact is:
- Required to exist
- Has a clearly defined authority
- Must always be consistent with other first-class artifacts
- Cannot be silently bypassed by agents or humans

It is part of the delivery contract, not a convenience.

- Agents may read all artifacts.
- Agents may generate some artifacts.
- Agents may **not** redefine the authority of any artifact.
- Humans own the accountability for the artifacts.


### 1. Intent Artifact (Feature Description)

**Role**

Defines *why* a change exists.

**Authority**

Human-owned intent.

**What it constrains**

* Scope
* Direction
* Acceptability of outcomes

**Purpose in ACD**

Intent is the trust anchor for all other first-class artifacts.


**Use Case example**

> User activity data export required for compliance.


### 2. User-Facing Behavior Artifact (Feature User Guide)

**Role**

Defines *what* the system does from the outside.

**Authority**

Externally observable semantics.

**What it constrains**

* Tests
* Implementation behavior
* Backwards compatibility expectations

**Purpose in ACD**

Prevent unexplained behavioral drift from implementation side effects.

**Use Case example**

> You can find the Activity Report under 'Profile' and can press 'Activity Export' to download your data.


### 3. Feature Implementation Description Artifact (Implementation Manual)

**Role**

Preserves *implementation trade-offs and constraints under which the solution is approached*

**Authority**

Engineering trade-offs and technical implementation guardrails.

**What it constrains**

* Technical decision boundaries
* Agentic degrees of freedom
* Inconsistency and drift

**Purpose in ACD**

Keep implementation consistent over time and avoid agentic tradeoff drift.

**Use Case example**

> The activity export is generated as a timestamped PDF to ensure immutability and regulatory compatibility. Each generated report is retained for non-repudiability.


### 4. Executable Truth Artifact (Test Scenarios)

**Role**

Makes intent falsifiable.

**Authority**

Pipeline-enforced correctness.

**What it constrains**

* Code
* Refactoring
* Optimization

**Purpose in ACD**

Ensure consistency of intent and implementation.

**Use Case example**

> Tests that ensure activity reports are correct and complete.


### 5. Implementation Artifact (Code)

**Role**

Implements behavior under constraint.

**Authority**

Runtime mechanism only.

**Purpose in ACD**

Deliver a solution for the intent that is consistent with required user-facing behaviour.

**Use Case example**

> Backend and frontend code to extract data, generate the report and transmit it to the user.



### 6. System Constraint Artifact (Architecture Overview)

**Role**

Defines *what must remain true globally*.

**Authority**

System-level invariants.

**What it constrains**

* All features
* All implementations
* All agent proposals

**Purpose in ACD**

Maintain global integrity.

**Use Case example**

> Use MVC architecture. There must be no business logic in APIs.


## Why These Artifacts Must Be Separate

They are intentionally **overlapping in content** but **non-overlapping in authority**.

This prevents a critical agentic failure mode:
> Resolving inconsistency by rewriting the wrong thing.


## Why This Is Not Documentation Overhead

ACD treats **semantic artifacts** as first-class to **preserve consistent meaning** over time.

In ACD:

* Artifacts are **inputs to enforcement**
* Not outputs for humans to read

They exist so that:

* tools can reference them
* agents can be constrained by them
* humans can steer **exceptions and conflicts**

Removing even a single first-class artifact reduces the reliability of ACD reference frame.

## Closing remarks

None of these artifacts are required exclusively when working with coding agents: They should exist for any long-term development project.
However, creating and maintaining them as part of the delivery process becomes crucial to minimize the risk of agent-induced failure.
